    Evaluate if the answer is complete, accurate, and properly supported by the available data.
    
    Consider:
    1. Does the answer directly address the question?
    2. Is the answer supported by the analysis data?
    3. Are there any gaps in the analysis that prevent a complete answer?
    4. Would additional analysis provide more valuable insights?
